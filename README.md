Each  model  was  then  deployed  to  the  hardware  described above.  Our  pipeline,  orchestrated  with  Python,  operates  withthree  concurrent  threads:  one  to  continuously  capture  audio received  from  an  attached  microphone  and  put  two  secondsworth  of  said  audio  onto  an  audio  analysis  queue;  one  to analyze sound samples retrieved from the audio analysis queueand  verify  whether  or  not  a  gunshot  occurred  in  a  given sample;  and  finally  one  to  dispatch  an  SMS  alert  messageto  a  predetermined  list  of  phone  numbers  if  a  gunshot  was detected in the segment of audio most recently analyzed. Raspbian Stretch, a Linux distribution designed specificallyfor the Raspberry Pi, was chosen as the base operating systemfor  our  pipeline.  However,  as  a  result  of  diminished  supportfor  later versions  of Python  3  in Raspbian  Stretch, we  choseto use Python 3.5 for the entirety of our project, including allproject  dependencies,  as  opposed  to  using  what  is  currentlythe latest Python version, Python 3.7. This decision was madebecause  the  only  official  software  repositories  available  inRaspbian Stretch do not at present house the updated packagesnecessary to run a newer version of Python 3 on the RaspberryPi  3  Model  B+.  Similarly,  because  of  the  ARM  architecture with  which  the  Raspberry  Pi  3  is  equipped,  update  releasesfor  Python  libraries  in  Raspbian  are  quite  behind  their  x86architecture counterparts.Besides  having  to  use  an  older  version  of  Python  fordevelopment  of  the  pipeline,  we  also  needed  to  find  andimplement  a  reputable  Python  library  for  interfacing  withthe  USB  microphone  connected  to  the  Raspberry  Pi.  Byvirtue  of  its  stability,  wealth  of  features,  and  total  possibleconfigurations,  the  library  we  chose  to  use  for  this  task  wasPyAudio  [11].  Using  this  library,  the  data  received  fromattached microphones is a stream  of 32-bit float values. Thisdata type works well with our models since the samples theywere trained on are of the same type and format.
