# gunshot_detection
Building a model that can detect gunshots from audio and that can also be scalably deployed to a Raspberry Pi cluster.

## Steps
### 1. Build a working gunshot model.
Input: Microphone audio.

Output: A Boolean value (i.e. Yes / No or 1 / 0).

### 2. Check if accuracy loss is acceptable. If it is not, return to step 1.

### 3. Deploy the model to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ for testing.

### 4. Feed into the model audio data coming from a microphone on the Raspberry Pi.

### 5. Test the model in real world scenarios. If the results are not acceptable, return to  step 1.
